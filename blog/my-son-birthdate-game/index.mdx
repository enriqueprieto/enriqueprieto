# A simple game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my son bityhdate (with help from ChatGPT)
---


## Introduction
To give you some context, I'm father and recently since I was writing this post, my son completed 3 years old. So, as the his birthdate is comming soon, my wife comes and asked for me "We need to create an invite for the birthdate paty of our son.", I just said "Let's dot it". In brainstorm of the invite design, my wife suggest some QR Code in the botton line of invite, in that moment I just ask to myself "QR Code? If you scanner the QR Code, what it is open in the parent device?", my wife like a queen of the caos just said "I don't know. Let's think more about it.". That's what we did. When I was working in the invite design using Figma, that moment come an insight about the QR Code, when the parent scanner the QR Code, a game will be opened in the parent device browser. Cool, right? But, How can I build a game using just HTML, CSS e Javascript left 2 weeks to my son birthdate and only 2 hours per-day free to make it? Challenge accepted! 

Firtly, when I had the ideia, I thought about the game, I am thought like the old race car like this:

<div
    style={{
        display: 'flex',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        marginTop: '8px',
        marginBottom: '8px'
    }}
>
    <img 
        src={require("./assets/race-car-inspiration.png").default} 
        loading="lazy"
        alt="Race car game inspiration"
    />
</div>

- Briefly introduce yourself and the context: why you wanted to create this game.
- Mention the inspiration behind the game and what you hoped to learn from the project.
- Highlight that you used ChatGPT as a coding partner to speed up the process and troubleshoot.

### 1. Planning the Game
- Describe the initial concept and features of the game (e.g., was it a quiz, a platformer, a puzzle?).
- Outline the goals: keeping the game simple, fun, and manageable as a solo project.
- Share any sketches, flowcharts, or basic outlines you created to organize the game mechanics.

### 2. Setting Up the Basics
- Explain how you started with a simple HTML structure.
- Share how you used CSS for basic styling, mentioning any specific challenges or tricks (like creating responsive elements or adding animations).
- Talk about how you structured your JavaScript code: functions, event listeners, game loops, or score counters.

### 3. Using ChatGPT as a Coding Partner
- Describe how ChatGPT helped you during development.
- Code assistance: generating starter code snippets, solving bugs, or optimizing logic.
- Learning resources: suggesting functions, explaining unfamiliar JavaScript methods, or breaking down complex tasks.
- Feedback: providing alternate approaches or ideas.
- Mention how working with ChatGPT saved time and encouraged you to experiment with different ideas.

### 4. Key Challenges and Solutions
- Detail any specific coding challenges you encountered.
- Examples: collision detection, animations, tracking score or lives, user input handling.
- Explain how you approached each problem, including ChatGPTâ€™s suggestions or any specific resources that were helpful.

### 5. Testing and Final Adjustments
- Describe the testing process and any issues you fixed.
- Share the process of tweaking game parameters to make gameplay more enjoyable.
- Include any final touches you added to improve the player experience (sound, animations, color schemes).

### 6. Final Thoughts
- Reflect on the experience: what did you learn, and what would you do differently next time?
- Mention the benefits of pairing with ChatGPT and how it changed your workflow.
- Conclude with encouragement for readers to try their own projects and consider using AI tools as development partners.

### 7. Demo and Code
- Add a link to a live demo (if available) and/or a GitHub repository with your code.
- Invite readers to check out the code, suggest improvements, or even fork the project to build their versions.
